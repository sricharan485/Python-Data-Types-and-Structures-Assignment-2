        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are important because they allow us to manage and manipulate data effectively for various tasks, making our programs more organized and efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Mutable data types can be changed after they are created. Examples include lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "my_list.append(4)  # The list is modified\n",
        "print(my_list)\n",
        "Immutable data types cannot be changed after they are created. Examples include strings, tuples, and numbers.\n",
        "my_string = \"hello\"\n",
        "# my_string[0] = \"H\" # This would cause an error\n",

        "print(new_string)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Mutability: Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable.\n",
        "Syntax: Lists are defined using square brackets [], while tuples are defined using parentheses ().\n",
        "- Use Cases: Lists are generally used for collections of items that might change, while tuples are used for collections where the order and elements should remain constant (e.g., coordinates, database records).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:  \n",
        "- Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs. Each key must be unique and immutable (like strings, numbers, or tuples), and it maps to a corresponding value, which can be of any data type. This allows for fast lookups based on the key.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "print(my_dict[\"name\"]) # Accessing a value using its key.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer :\n",
        "\n",
        "- You might use a set instead of a list when you need to:\n",
        "Store a collection of unique elements (sets automatically remove duplicates).\n",
        "Perform fast membership testing (checking if an item is in the set).\n",
        "Perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "-  A string is a sequence of characters. While both strings and lists are sequences, the key difference is that strings are immutable (cannot be changed after creation), while lists are mutable. You can access individual characters in a string or elements in a list using indexing, but you can't change a character in an existing string.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Tuples ensure data integrity because they are immutable. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. This prevents accidental modification of the data, making them suitable for storing data that should not be altered.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets, where the values are stored. Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, which allows for efficient average-case time complexity for operations like insertion, deletion, and retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        " -  Yes, lists in Python can contain elements of different data types. You can have a list with integers, strings, floats, other lists, or any combination of data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " CODE:\n",
        "\n",
        "     mixed_list = [1, \"hello\", 3.14, [5, 6]]\n",
        "  \n",

        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "  \n",
        " - Strings are immutable in Python because this design choice has several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Efficiency: Immutability allows for certain optimizations, such as sharing the same string object in memory when multiple variables point to the same string value.\n",
        "  \n",
        " - Thread Safety: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe because their state cannot be changed by multiple threads simultaneously.\n",
        "  \n",
        " - Hashability: Immutable objects can be used as keys in dictionaries and     elements in sets because their hash value remains constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Dictionaries offer advantages over lists when you need to:\n",
        "  Quickly access data using a key: Dictionaries provide O(1) average-case time complexity for lookups, which is much faster than searching through a list (O(n)).\n",
        "  Store data with meaningful labels: Keys in a dictionary provide a clear way to identify and retrieve associated values.\n",
        "  Represent relationships between data: Dictionaries are ideal for representing objects or structures with named attributes.\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        " - A scenario where using a tuple would be preferable is when you need to represent a collection of related items that should not be changed, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Coordinates: Representing a point in 2D or 3D space (e.g., (x, y) or (x, y, z)).\n",
        "  Database Records: Representing a single row from a database table where the order and values are fixed.\n",
        "Function Return Values: Returning multiple values from a function as a single, unchangeable unit.\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Sets in Python automatically handle duplicate values by only storing one instance of each unique element. When you add a duplicate element to a set, it is simply ignored.\n",
        "\n",
        "my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5}\n",
        "print(my_set) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
        "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "- For lists, the in keyword checks if an element is present among the values    in  the list. It performs a linear search, so the time complexity is O(n).\n",
        " For dictionaries, the in keyword checks if a key exists in the dictionary. It uses hashing for efficient lookup, so the average-case time complexity is O(1).\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "- No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable. Once a tuple is created, its contents are fixed. If you need to change the collection, you would need to create a new tuple with the desired modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        " - A nested dictionary is a dictionary where the values are themselves dictionaries. This allows you to represent hierarchical data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Use Case Example: Representing information about multiple students, where each student's data is stored in a separate dictionary within the main dictionary.\n",
        " - CODE:\n",
        "\n",
        "   students =\n",
        "   {\n",
        "      \"student1\": {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 20, \"major\": \"Computer Science\"},\n",
        "      \"student2\": {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 22, \"major\": \"Engineering\"}\n",
        "    }\n",
        "\n",
        " print(students[\"student1\"][\"major\"]).\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        " - The average-case time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary using its key is O(1) (constant time). This is because dictionaries use hash tables for efficient key lookups. In the worst case (due to hash collisions), it can be O(n), but this is rare with good hash functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        " -  Lists are preferred over dictionaries when:\n",
        " You need an ordered collection of items.\n",
        " You want to store a sequence of items and access them by their position (index).\n",
        " You need to allow duplicate elements.\n",
        " The order of elements is important.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Historically, dictionaries in Python were considered unordered because the order of elements was not guaranteed to be the insertion order. However, since Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain insertion order. While this makes them ordered in practice, the fundamental way they store data (using hash tables) means that accessing elements is based on the key's hash value, not its position in the dictionary. This doesn't affect data retrieval speed (still O(1) on average), but it's a conceptual difference from sequence types like lists where order is inherent to access.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval. Can you please give me the answer with example in Brief?\n",
